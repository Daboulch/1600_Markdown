My favorite kind of music is **rock** and more specifically **indie rock** but I enjoy most genres as long as the song sounds good.
My favorite indie rock band is [Last Dinosaurs](https://open.spotify.com/artist/677sHrkjhB7IP4YwjzZyc4)
The song that got me listening them is called "Zoom" from their albumn _In A Million Years_ and it is my favorite albumn from them.

Some other songs I've listened to recently include
- "That I Miss You" by Vansire
- "I Will Survive" by Cake (Remake of the 1978 Version)
- "The Kill" by Thirty Seconds To Mars
