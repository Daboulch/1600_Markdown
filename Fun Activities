## Fun Activities

1. I enjoy swimming and competively swam in highschool!
2. I also enjoy rock climbing.
3. I've had snowboarding on my bucketlist for a long time and hopefully will get to try it soon.
4. Playing games whether they're online, a board game, or just some simple cards is always fun.
5. I recently tried some baking which was fun and pretty rewarding when I was finally done.
